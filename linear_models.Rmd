## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
---
title: "Linear Models"
output: github_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,
	fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```


Load NYC Airbnb data.

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group
  ) %>% 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, borough, neighbourhood, room_type)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
